## Setup and instruction

**Setup**

you need to install `nodejs` & `npm` in your system to run this project. Once you have installed the nodejs and npm in your system, you need to install the project dependencies.

This project depends on a text file which is stored in **pdf** folder.

**Instruction**

```bash
npm i
```

## Running project

Run this command in the project root

npm start
```

See the temp folder for the output file.

## Optional

I have implemented extra logic for [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin). For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added.

Run this command in the project root

```bash
npm start -- algo
```
